byteENGINE AM335x
--------------------

-  **General Information**: The byteENGINE AM335x is a high performance
   industrial oriented computing module. It allows a short
   time-to-market, while reducing development costs and substantial
   design risks. The system on module (SOM) uses the Texas Instruments
   AM335x industrial applications processor family. The AM335x features
   a PowerVRTM SGX Graphics Accelerator Subsystem for 3D graphics
   acceleration. The Programmable Real-Time Unit and Industrial
   Communication Subsystem (PRU-ICSS) allows independent operation from
   the ARM processor. PRU-ICSS enables real-time protocols such as
   EtherCAT, PROFINET, EtherNet/IP, PROFIBUS, Ethernet Powerlink and
   Sercos.

byteENGINE STM32MP1x
--------------------

-  **General Information**: The byteENGINE STM32MP1x is a high
   performance industrial oriented computing module. It allows you a
   short time-to-market, reducing development costs and substantial
   design risks.

   **The system on module (SOM)** uses the STM32MP15xxAC devices which
   are based on the high-performance dual-core ARM® Cortex®-A7 32-bit
   RISC core operating at up to 650 MHz/800 MHz. The STM32MP15xxAC
   devices also embed a Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at up to
   200 MHz frequency. The Cortex®-M4 core features a floating point unit
   (FPU) single precision which supports ARM® single-precision
   dataprocessing instructions and data types.

   **Furthermore, the STM32MP15xxAC** devices embed a 3D graphic
   processing unit (Vivante® - OpenGL® ES 2.0) running at up to 533 MHz,
   with performances up to 26 Mtriangle/s, 133 Mpixel/s.
